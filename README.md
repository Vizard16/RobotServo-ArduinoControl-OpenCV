# Robotics Summer Program Final Project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Vizard16/repo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Vizard16/RobotServo-ArduinoControl-OpenCV)

On Summer I had the opportunity to visit one of the most technological cities in the world, Tokyo. There I assist as a student the Shibaura University. Where I learned about robotics and how to implement new technologies into robotics. 

There I worked with Python library OpenCV to make a program that takes facial detection and convertes it to motion data for the robot programmed and made with Arduino. So when the user moved the face also the robot moved.
